WTForms-Components

# Even though we're
# not using SQLAlchemy yet, the WTForms-Components library uses it and installs
# a version of SQLAlchemy (1.4) that's brand new and has a ton of breaking changes.
#
# To fix that we need to explicitly lock down SQLAlchemy to an older version
# that works with most libraries. That's what this line below is doing.
